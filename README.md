# ToDoList
A simple to-do list application that allows users to add, remove, and view tasks. Part of my personal practice projects.
Requirements:
- Store tasks in a list
- Allow users to add tasks
- Allow users to remove tasks
- Display the task list
- Save tasks to a file so they persist between runs (optional)
